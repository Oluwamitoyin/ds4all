# The Aim
This session's goal is to familiarize you with programming concepts through the initial writing of structured instructions. After that, we'll quickly get started with Python using the  Jupyter Notebook environment. Python and programming will be introduced in this session. It is crucial to take the time to comprehend these fundamental ideas.
